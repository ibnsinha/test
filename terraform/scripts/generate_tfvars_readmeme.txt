Key Accomplishments:

Successfully developed and deployed an automation framework to manage AWS IAM roles, including:

Importing deprecated roles,

Cleaning up unused roles,

Hardening existing roles to follow least-privilege principles.

Designed and implemented Terraform modules and GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate multi-account IAM role updates.

Leveraged Python to dynamically generate Terraform configurations, improving consistency and reducing manual intervention.

Rolled out the solution across multiple AWS accounts with strong cross-team collaboration, improving overall cloud security posture.

Gained deeper proficiency in AWS IAM, GitLab CI/CD, and Terraform, contributing to team capability and platform resilience.

Opportunities for Improvement:

Continue strengthening FinOps awareness by identifying cost-saving opportunities in non-production AWS environments.

Improve documentation and knowledge sharing to enable broader adoption of automation frameworks across teams.

Increase visibility by proactively demoing solutions and gathering feedback from stakeholders and cloud governance groups.

Developmental Progress:

Expanded technical skills in infrastructure-as-code and pipeline orchestration.

Took ownership of a security-critical initiative and delivered tangible outcomes aligned with organizational goals.

Planning to explore advanced policy validation tools and develop more reusable cloud automation patterns in H2.

Let me know if you'd like to tailor this for a leadership audience, or if your company uses a specific performance review format (e.g., STAR, 4-box, etc.).
